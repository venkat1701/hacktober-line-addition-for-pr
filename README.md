## Contributing Guide

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re excited to have you contribute to this project. Hereâ€™s a beginner-friendly guide to help you get started.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top right of this repository page. This creates a personal copy of the project in your GitHub account.
2. After forking, youâ€™ll have a new repository in your account (e.g., `your-username/hacktober-line-addition-for-pr`).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

To make changes locally, clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlazePhenom/hacktober-line-addition-for-pr.git
```

> **Note**: Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

It's best practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. In your terminal, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd hacktober-line-addition-for-pr
```

Then, create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b add-new-spaces
```

> **Note**: Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-new-line` or `add-new-comment`).

### Step 4: Make Changes

Now youâ€™re ready to make changes! Open the project in your favorite code editor, make the changes you want, and save them.

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once youâ€™ve made and saved your changes, itâ€™s time to commit them. First, stage the files you changed:

```bash
git add .
```

Next, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Briefly describe what you changed"
```

### Step 6: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Push your changes to the branch on your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin add-new-spaces
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Pull Request** on the left, then click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select the branch you just pushed and click **Create Pull Request**.
4. Add a title and description for your changes, then submit the pull request.

Once youâ€™ve created the pull request, we will potentially merge it into the main project!
